<title>Parallelize Bitcoin Trading Algorithm by Thomas Mayo-Smith</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I plan to implement a bitcoin trading algorithm (prefferably the "Bayesian Regression" algorithm developed by Devavrant Shah and Kang Zhang such that it is able to trade at higher frequencies and such that the parameters of this algorithm can be tuned faster.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>An overview of the algorithm is best described here: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.1231v1.pdf</p>
<h3>The Main Algorithm Steps</h3>
<xmp>
%algo trading

%import prices and dateTime as column vectors from the csv sheet
%about 120 000 values
importcsv();

assert(length(prices) == length(askVolume));
assert(length(prices) == length(bidVolume));
prices = transpose(prices);

prices = prices(1:2:length(prices)); %turns 5s to 10s steps
askVolume = askVolume(1:2:length(askVolume));
bidVolume = bidVolume(1:2:length(bidVolume));

prices1 = prices(1:20000); 
prices2 = prices(20001:40000);
prices3 = prices(40001:length(prices));

%#############################
%#step 1: creating intervals S_j
%#############################
%#create list of all 720*10s, 360*10s and 180*10s intervals
%#each item is (interval of prices, NEXT TEN SEC interval price change)

priceDiff = diff(prices);
validIntSize = length(prices1)-750; %valid interval size
interval720s = zeros(validIntSize,720+1);
interval360s = zeros(validIntSize,360+1);
interval180s = zeros(validIntSize,180+1); 

for i = 1:validIntSize   
    interval180s(i,:) = [prices1(i:i+179),priceDiff(i+179)]; 
    interval360s(i,:) = [prices1(i:i+359),priceDiff(i+359)]; 
    interval720s(i,:) = [prices1(i:i+719),priceDiff(i+719)];   
end

%#now we k-means cluster all 3 interval lists to get the 20 best patterns
%#for each of the interval lists 
clusters = 20;

[~,kmeans180s] = kmeans(interval180s,clusters); 
[~,kmeans360s] = kmeans(interval360s,clusters); 
[~,kmeans720s] = kmeans(interval720s,clusters); %this one has difficulty converging

%TODO for speed, use similarity instead of L2 norm for kmeans?

for i = 1:clusters
    kmeans180s(i,1:180) = zscore(kmeans180s(i,1:180));
    kmeans360s(i,1:360) = zscore(kmeans360s(i,1:360));
    kmeans720s(i,1:720) = zscore(kmeans720s(i,1:720));
end

disp('finished clustering and normalizing');

%#step 2: predicting average price change dp_j and learning parameters w_i
%#using Bayesian regression
%#
%#equation:
%#dp = w0 + w1*dp1 + w2*dp2 + w3*dp3 + w4*r
%################

regressorX = zeros(length(prices2)-750-1,4);
regressorY = zeros(1,length(prices2)-750-1);

for i= 750:length(prices2)-1
    price180 = prices2(i-179:i);      
    price360 = prices2(i-359:i);      
    price720 = prices2(i-719:i);
    
%#average price change dp_j is given by bayesian regression    
    dp1 = bayesian(price180, kmeans180s);
    dp2 = bayesian(price360, kmeans360s);
    dp3 = bayesian(price720, kmeans720s);
    
    r = (bidVolume(i)-askVolume(i))/(bidVolume(i)+askVolume(i)); 
    
    regressorX(i-749,:) = [dp1,dp2,dp3,r];
    regressorY(i-749) = prices2(i+1)-prices2(i);   
end

%last parameter is regularization gamma, need to find a good value TODO
[theta, theta0] = train_regressor(regressorX, transpose(regressorY), 1);
disp('finished regression, ready to trade');

m = length(prices1) + length(prices2); %we want to take bid/ask data from right index

%start trading with last list of prices

[bank,error] = brtrade(prices3, kmeans180s,kmeans360s,kmeans720s,theta,theta0,bidVolume(m:end),askVolume(m:end));

<p>There are several sections of this code which can be parallelized.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Creating Intervals: Each bitcoin price interval is independent of the others created thus this can be done in parallel</li>
	<li>Finding the special patterns in these price intervals with respect to how they influence the price change at the end of their periods using k-means can be done in parallel since how each interval is mapped to a centroid is independent of any other work. There are several thousand intervals of lengths 180, 360 and 720 each of which need to be mapped to a centroid every step of the k-means algorithm.</li>
	<li>Once the top 20 clusters for each price interval lenght are found </li>
	<li>Also it should be noted that although the algorithm displayed above only finds patterns once a live trading algorithm would do this periodically given the state of bitcoin (a global currency) changes often.</li>
	<li>The linear regression step in the above algorithm can be parallelized given the costly matrix multiplication sections of this step and the high dimentionality of the data.</li>
	<li>Testing how well this algorithm does with new data can also be done in parallel because unlike a live trading algorithm which will make for instance 1 trade every 10 seconds as data is steadily provided, during testing all the data already exists. Thus every trade can be made in parallel and the final results of these trades can be tallied up at the end.</li>
</ul>




<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fully understanding the theory behind "Basian Regression" will be difficult to understand, but absolutely necessary in order for me to tune and debug the algorithm once I have it running.</li>
	<li>There needs to be communication amongst threads during and in between each of the parallization oppertunities I described.</li>
	<li>Linear regression can be sped up by paralelizing the matrix multiplication or by parallelizing a seris of QR decompositions. I am completely unfamiliar with the latter method and it seems to be faster.</li>
	<li>I understand how to parallelize my code via multiple threads; however, don't know how to use multiple machines. (This was done for us in the Dynamic Web-Server Project)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Latedays cluster machine (Xeon Phi co-processor) for preformance testing</li>
	<li>Gates machines for functional testing</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software<h3>
<ul>
	<li>bitcoin price data set</li>
	<li>bitcoin ask/bid data set</li>
	<li>Matlab (to run sequential version of the data set)</li>
	<li>Sequential matlab code found here: https://github.com/panditanvita/BTCpredictor</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Implement a sequential version of the bitcoin trading algorithm on the latedays cluster and compare the speed of this version against a parallelized version. Compare the parallelized latedays version with the parallelized matlab version running on my laptop.</li>
	<li>Get a better understanding of how each type of parallelization strategy affects speedup of the process of training and testing trading algorithm.</li>
	<li>Given enough time I would like to pinpoint the fastest frequency this trading algorithm would be able to trade at if it were to run on such a high end machine like latedays.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Platform Choice</h2>
<p>Use the std::thread library, ISPC framework and OpenMPI to leverage all paralelization capabilities of the Xeon Phi processor on the Lateday's Cluster.</p>

<h2>Schedule</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fri, April 8 - Implement data interval maker. Implement a sequential k-means algorithm.</li>
	<li>Fri, April 15 - Parallelize data interval maker and k-means algorithm + get preformance results.</li>
	<li>Fri, April 22 - Implement a paralellized linear regression algorithm + get preformance results.</li>
	<li>Fri, April 29 - Implement the trading algorithm + get preformance results.</li>
	<li>Fri, May 6 - Find fastest trading frequency + tuning parameters + possibly deploy algorithm.</li>
</ul>
